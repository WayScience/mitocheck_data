# 4. Preprocess Features

In this module, we present our pipeline for preprocessing features.
### Feature Preprocessing

We use [PyCytominer](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer), commit [`fcf03b6`](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer/commit/fcf03b60e7591b45e82acd6662d6bb0182f8f1cf), to preprocess features.
